# DirectoryForEmployees
This is a full-stack application that allows the user to see the directory of 
employees at the company. This application uses React to render the information to the front end.

You can enter the name of the employees by typing in their names at the search box. The application will then render the employee with their names, email addresses and phone numbers.
